# Onboarding Guide

## What this is

Virtual Revelation is a production surface for shared, deterministic worlds compiled from an append-only event log.

## First user checklist

1. Open the broker: `https://tetragrammatron-os.com/broker/`.
2. Choose a template and click **Open Workspace**.
3. Open the wiki: `https://tetragrammatron-os.com/wiki/`.
4. Read the Welcome page and add a first note.
5. Share the workspace using the Share panel.

## Roles

- **Observer**: reads projections only.
- **Contributor**: emits events (canvas/wiki/forum inputs).
- **Operator**: enables services and manages deployments.

## Where to start

- Canvas: visual thinking and node/edge exploration.
- Wiki: structured notes and append-only documentation.
- Forum: threaded discussions.

## Support notes

- All changes are append-only events.
- Projections are derived; no direct state edits.
- If transport fails, the UI falls back automatically.
